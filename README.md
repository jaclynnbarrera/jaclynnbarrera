### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer based in NYC. As a creative, Iâ€™m driven by art, technology, music and culture. Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable applications and experiences that can help make a difference or simply brighten someones day.

Iâ€™m a recent graduate of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. Previously, I worked as a marketing and community manager at a job platform start-up built for creatives of all different mediums and skills where I often collaborated with designers and developers.

When I'm not coding, I shoot film photography, make way too many music playlists and hang out with my dog Appa. Iâ€™m currently based in New York, where I was born and raised.
