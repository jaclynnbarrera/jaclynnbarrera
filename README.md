### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer based in NYC. As a creative, Iâ€™m driven by art, technology, music and culture. Iâ€™m passionate about building scalable applications and experiences that can help make a difference or simply brighten someones day.

When I'm not coding, I shoot film photography, make way too many music playlists and hang out with my dog Appa.
